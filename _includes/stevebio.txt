I am PhD student in Dr. Markus Schober's lab working on how tumor initiating cells maintain their ability to generate tumors.  I believe that the research discovery to market route is the most effective way to bring about a positive change for people on a global scale.  I am very interested in the process of bringing the discoveries made at the bench to a wider audience.  This includes raising awareness in the general New York scientific community - students, postdocs, and faculty - about opportunities in biotech and also helping to develop the tools that are needed to branch into that area.
