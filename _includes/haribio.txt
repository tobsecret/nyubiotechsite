I am a PhD student being co-advised by Dr. Daniel Turnbull and Dr. Fernando Boada studying early detection and treatment monitoring techniques for brain cancers using multi-modality imaging strategies. I am very interested in pursuing (and helping others pursue) “alternative” career paths after their graduate studies.
