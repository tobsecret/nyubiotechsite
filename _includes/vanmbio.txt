 am a recently graduated PhD eager to blaze paths at the intersection of engineering, science, and communication. While my educational experiences in bioengineering, cardiac electrophysiology, prototyping, and consulting have been diverse and somewhat disparate, what ultimately motivates me is to better understand how the world works and to constantly push boundaries and learn! My specific goals in the biotech club are to help expose scientists to the variety of entrepreneurial opportunities in the greater NYC community and to empower women to excel in traditionally masculine environments.
