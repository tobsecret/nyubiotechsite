While learning about the intricacies of cytokine signaling in the context of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling axis during my PhD training in biophysics in the laboratory of Dr. Moosa Mohammadi, I had a unique opportunity to witness first-hand the development of a therapeutic we developed in collaboration with Pfizer. This partnership opened my perspectives to the career options PhD students are able to pursue with their finely-tuned analytical skills.

My career goals currently lay at the intersection of scientific innovation and policy, where appropriate laws and regulations have the ability to facilitate funding, constructive evaluations, and even changing current guidelines to give previously rejected therapies and devices a chance to be repurposed and engineered to address the optimal people groups. Transparent collaboration between governing policies, pharmaceutical industries, and the all encompassing academic sector will prove vital for the continuation of developing therapies for ill-understood diseases.
