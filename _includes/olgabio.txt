I’m a PhD candidate in Cell and Molecular biology, investigating how commensal biofilm affect host’s aging, stress-resistance and innate immune response utilizing simple model organism, C. elegans. In parallel, I’m actively pursuing self-education in financial markets and financial modeling to gain in-depth understanding of financial operation and development in biotech sector. I see the future of NYU Biotech Club as key element in helping scientist to follow their passion for technology implementation.
