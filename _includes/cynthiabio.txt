I am a Ph.D. candidate in the laboratory of Dr. Susan Schwab. I am studying the role of chemokine receptor signaling in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia to aid in the development of new therapeutic targets and clinical prognostic markers for the leukemia. Prior to joining NYU, I worked at a boutique, healthcare agency to develop market insights, corporate strategy and media relations for clients ranging from small biotech companies to large consumer good corporations. I hope to bring the insights gained from my industry experience to the NYUBA and continue to explore collaborative relationships between academia and biotech.
