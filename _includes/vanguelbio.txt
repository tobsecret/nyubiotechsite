I’m an international PhD candidate working on Blood Stem Cell emergence. I’m very interested in following and contributing to the ever-growing Healthcare environment in NY and my personal goal is to build bridges between the NY based Graduate Biotech clubs to create an easy access, stable collaboration platform that would connect the student and postdoc talent to Biotechnology companies and Big Pharma.
