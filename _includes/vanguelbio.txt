I’m an international PhD candidate from Bulgaria. I’m working on Blood Stem Cell emergence and specification in the Lab of Dr. Matthias Stadtfeld. I’m very interested in the ever-growing Healthcare Startup environment in NY and my goal is to build bridges between the NY based Biotech university clubs to create an easy access, stable collaboration platform that would increase student exposure to Biotechnology companies and Big Pharma.
