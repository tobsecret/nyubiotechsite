I am a Ph.D candidate at the NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center in the lab of Ramanuj Dasgupta. My research focuses on understanding how beta-catenin, a protein which is commonly misregulated in a number of cancer types, regulates the proliferation and survival of cancer and cancer stem cells. In my time at NYU, I have become increasingly interested in the intersection of biology and business, taking every opportunity to learn about topics such as funding startups, modeling drug revenue, and developing intellectual property. With the NYUBA, my goal is to help students and postdocs learn about and prepare for career opportunities outside of academia and connect them with both industry professionals and other students with similar interests.
