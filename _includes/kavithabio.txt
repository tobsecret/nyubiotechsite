I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Structural Biology at NYU. I investigate how kinase mutations cause cancer and aim to design potent cancer therapeutics using structure-based drug discovery. At NYUBA, I organize case studies that are aimed at educating students and postdocs about cutting-edge technologies, drug development, and product commercialization.
