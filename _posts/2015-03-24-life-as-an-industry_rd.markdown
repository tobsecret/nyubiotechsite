synopsis: Dr. Mark Kaplan of Pfizer CTI visited the NYU Medical Center to discuss life in the industry and answer questions about the skills and training that are important for a successful transition out of academia.
---

On Monday evening, students and postdocs from NYU and other medical institutions across NYC filled Alumni Hall at the Langone Medical Center. They came to listen to Dr. Mark Kaplan, a senior principal scientist at Pfizer CTI, discuss what life was like as an R&D scientist and talk about his own journey from academia to industry.

Dr. Kaplan spent time at several biotech and pharma companies, including Celera Genomics and Roche, before taking his current position with Pfizer. At the CTI (Centers for Therapeutic Innovation) in the Alexandria Center, he acts as a project leader, working on collaborations with academic labs in the New York area.

The audience had a number of questions about how industry jobs differed from those in academia, and what skills companies looked for when hiring academics without industry experience. Here are several key takeaways from the session:

* If you like answering questions, you might be better suited for academia. If you like solving problems, industry is probably a better match.

* There are two main types of skills that companies look for when hiring academics. One is knowledge of a general therapeutic area, such as oncology. The other is a specific technical skill, such as being able to make knockout mice or use CRISPR for gene editing. (And it never hurts to have a personal connection!)

* How important is your publishing record in getting a job? While it helps to have a good first author paper, it is more important to be able to tell a good story. Be able to clearly define your research question, explain your approach, and describe your findings.

* There are a lot of non-science skills that are important to industry success but arenâ€™t explicitly taught in academia, such as leadership and teamwork. Some of these skills you simply pick up on the job in industry, while others are more innate. If you have experiences that can highlight these skills, include them in your resume/CV!



*The NYU BioVenture Speaker Series provides a foundation in business knowledge for venture creation. The series is co-sponsored by the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute and the NYU Biotech Association Club.*
