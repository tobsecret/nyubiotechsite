synopsis: The second in the NYU BioVentures series, co-presented by NYU Entrepreneurial Institute, was focused on the business side of research, and understanding the market for your scientific idea.
---
In the latest edition of the NYU BioVenture Speaker Series, Dr. Michael Ritchie, Director of Business Development at Champions Oncology, Inc., shared his insights into modeling and shaping markets with a group of eager students and postdocs.

Early on, Dr. Ritchie emphasized the changing landscape of the pharmaceutical industry, noting that the role of pharmaceutical companies is trending increasingly towards funding clinical trials, while most of the real innovation is happening in startup companies and academic labs. He also made it clear identifying and understanding your target market is critical for successful commercialization of a product.

“Your project means the world to you,” he told the audience at the Langone Medical Center. “Maybe you can’t put a value on the time you’ve put in, but the people who are going to invest in you need to know what they will get out of it.”

Dr. Ritchie also shared some of his personal experiences as he transitioned from the lab bench to the business side of research. After receiving his Ph.D from Temple, he spent time as a postdoc at Harvard Medical School and worked as an Oncology Scientist at Pfizer before taking his current role at Champions.
