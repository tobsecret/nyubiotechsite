The NYUBA is a student-run organization from the NYU School of Medicine. Our objective is to educate graduate students and post-doctoral researchers about the applications of biomedical science to multifaceted disciplines including industry, business, law, and translational research.

The majority of graduate programs prepare students exclusively for careers in academia, with little or no focus on understanding alternative applications of their education.

The NYUBA is dedicated to informing and encouraging the greater NYU community about the diverse application of their academic expertise.
