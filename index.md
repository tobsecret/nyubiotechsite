<h2 style="color:#005b7f">Our Mission</h2>

The principal aim of the NYUBA is to educate graduate students and post-doctoral scientists in the biological sciences about the many applications of biomedical research in multifaceted disciplines including industry, business, law, and translational research.

The majority of graduate programs prepare students exclusively for careers in academia, with little or no focus on understanding alternative applications of their education.

The NYUBA is dedicated to informing and encouraging the greater NYU community about the diverse application of their academic expertise.
