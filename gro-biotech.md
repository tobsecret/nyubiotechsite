__About GRO-Biotech__

Founded in 2015, GRO-­Biotech is a coalition of graduate biotechnology organizations from the top life sciences programs in NYC ­­ (NYU, Cornell, Mount Sinai, CUNY Hunter, Columbia, Rockefeller, Sloan Kettering, and Albert Einstein) ­­ with a reach of over 500 graduate students, medical students, postdoctoral researchers, and clinicians. 

Our mission is to provide our members with opportunities to learn about areas of drug development, healthcare, business, and life sciences entrepreneurship that they might not otherwise encounter in a traditional science training program.
